# QuestSage: Multi-Agent Research Synthesis System

QuestSage is a sophisticated multi-agent research synthesis system that combines AI agents with comprehensive research capabilities to provide high-quality, evidence-based analysis on complex topics. The system operates in two distinct modes: **Development** and **Production**, each optimized for different use cases.

## üéØ System Purpose

QuestSage is designed to generate high-quality, research-backed insights by orchestrating multiple AI agents through a structured research pipeline. It's particularly effective for complex research questions that require:

- **Multi-source evidence synthesis** (academic papers, industry reports, social media, deep research)
- **Agent-based dialogue** for comprehensive analysis
- **Evidence quality assessment** and contradiction detection
- **Structured research workflows** with human-in-the-loop oversight

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system follows a **two-tier LLM architecture**:

- **Flash LLM**: Fast, cost-effective processing for initial analysis, fact extraction, and surface research
- **Pro LLM**: High-quality, strategic analysis for complex reasoning, agent orchestration, and final synthesis

### Core Components

- **Frontend**: React-based UI with real-time research progress tracking
- **Backend**: Express.js server with modular service architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configurable for Neon or local)
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude integration
- **Search Services**: Google Search, arXiv, Reddit, Perplexity Deep Search

## üîÑ Development vs Production Modes

### Development Mode (`dev`)
- **Purpose**: Testing, development, and demonstration without external API costs
- **Features**:
  - Mock data generation for all research stages
  - Simulated AI responses with realistic delays
  - No external API calls or costs
  - Perfect for development, testing, and demos
- **Use Cases**: Development, testing, demonstrations, cost-free exploration

### Production Mode (`prod`)
- **Purpose**: Real research with live data and AI services
- **Features**:
  - Live API calls to search engines and AI services
  - Real-time data collection and analysis
  - Actual cost implications for API usage
  - Production-grade research capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Real research projects, client work, production deployments

## üöÄ How to Switch Between Modes

### Method 1: UI Toggle (Recommended)
1. Start the application
2. Look for the **Dev Mode** toggle switch in the top-right corner
3. Click to switch between Dev (checked) and Prod (unchecked) modes
4. The system will automatically update the backend configuration

### Method 2: Environment Variable
Set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:
```bash
# Development mode
export NODE_ENV=development

# Production mode  
export NODE_ENV=production
```

### Method 3: API Call
```bash
# Switch to production mode
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "prod"}'

# Switch to development mode
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "dev"}'
```

## üìã What's Missing (Current Limitations)

### 1. **Authentication & User Management**
- User registration and login system is defined in schema but not implemented
- No session management or user isolation
- All research sessions are currently shared

### 2. **Database Persistence**
- System defaults to in-memory storage (`MemStorage`)
- PostgreSQL integration exists but requires manual configuration
- No data migration or backup capabilities

### 3. **Error Handling & Monitoring**
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- No comprehensive logging or monitoring
- Missing rate limiting and API quota management

### 4. **Advanced Features**
- No real-time collaboration between users
- Limited export capabilities (PDF, Word, etc.)
- No version control for research sessions
- Missing advanced search filters and sorting

### 5. **Security & Compliance**
- No input sanitization or validation
- Missing audit trails for research sessions
- No GDPR/privacy compliance features

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run QuestSage

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database (optional, for production)

### 1. **Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd QuestSage
npm install
```

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
# Database (optional for dev mode)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/questsage

# AI Service API Keys (required for production mode)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key

# Search Service API Keys (required for production mode)
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_google_key
REDDIT_API_KEY=your_reddit_key

# System Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
MAX_DIALOGUE_ROUNDS=7
```

### 3. **Database Setup (Optional)**
If using PostgreSQL:
```bash
# Push schema to database
npm run db:push

# Or run migrations manually
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. **Start the Application**

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Starts both frontend and backend
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- Hot reloading enabled

#### Production Mode
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
- Serves built frontend from backend
- Single port (default: 5000)
